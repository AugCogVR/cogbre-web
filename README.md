# cogbre-web
Web client for CogBRE Nexus. It is very bare-bones and developed specifically for one condition of a user study. It may not ever be more than that. [Oxide](https://github.com/Program-Understanding/oxide), essentially "the" backend for CogBRE, has its own much nicer web app [here](https://github.com/Program-Understanding/oxide/tree/main/web_app). 

Note: Needs package `react-zoom-pan-pinch`
